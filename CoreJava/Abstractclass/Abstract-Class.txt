Abstract classes are not Interfaces. 
--------------------------------------
An abstract class must have an abstract method.
Abstract classes can have Constructors, Member variables and Normal methods.
Abstract classes are never instantiated.
When you extend Abstract class with abstract method, you must define the abstract method in the child class, or make the child class abstract.

Abstraction is an important feature of OOPS. It means hiding complexity. Abstract class is used to provide abstraction. Although it does not provide 100% abstraction because it can also have concrete method. Lets see how abstract class is used to provide abstraction.

abstract class Vehicle
{
   public abstract void engine();  //abstract method
}
public class Car extends Vehicle
 {
    
    public void engine()
    {
        System.out.println("Car engine");
        //car engine implementation
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Vehicle v = new Car();
        v.engine();
        
    }
}
